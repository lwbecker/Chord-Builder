Chord Builder Game Description
Created by: Liam Becker, Anna Serenius, and Kirsten Freeman

Intended Audience:
Chord Builder is supposed to be both fun and educational for people of all ages. Our intended audience is people who want to learn more about music in an interactive way. 
This game can be played by those with visual impairments who use a screen reader or those with motor impairments. 

How to Begin Gameplay:
To start the game, press the spacebar. The staff will appear on screen, and you will be given the name of a chord, along with the four notes that make up the chord - but wait, some of the notes may be incorrect! After the notes are loaded onto the staff, each will be played in succession, and then all the notes will be played together. 
To change between the notes of the chord, press the left and right arrow keys. To change a note’s accidental, use the spacebar. 
Whenever the user returns to the root note of the chord, the chord will be played in succession, the same way it was at the beginning of the game. 
Once the user has all the notes in the chord correctly placed with the correct accidentals, the chord will be played in succession again, and then the user will be given a new chord to play.

Objective of the Game:
At the start of the game, the user is given only major (or “happy”) chords to correct. After the user has corrected all of the major chords, he/she will be given minor chords, and then diminished chords. Once you’ve corrected all the different categories of chords, you win!
